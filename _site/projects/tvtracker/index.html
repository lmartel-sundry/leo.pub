<h1>TVTracker</h1>

<p>My first major, finished(ish) personal project. Pumped!</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create an account</li>
<li>Start tracking existing TV shows--or add your own!</li>
<li>Read plot summaries and actor lists</li>
<li>Keep track of which episodes you've watched, and when the next one's airing</li>
<li>Enjoy some snazzy jQuery</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why I made it</h2>

<p>I got to play around with APIs, somewhat-complex jQuery, and deal with building a
full rails app from start to finish.</p>

<p>I also actually use this to keep track of all the TV shows I [never have time to] watch
--and I hope that someone else will too. That'd be exciting.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>TVTracker uses two APIs to gather the information it needs:
* <a href="http://wwwtvrage.com/" title="TVRage">TVRage</a> for the episode lists
* <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" title="OMDB">OMDB</a> for the posters and show-level information like plot summaries</p>

<h1>Url Shortener</h1>

<p>A simple link shortener hosted at <a href="http://s.lpm.io">my personal website</a>. This was a fun little project, inspired by my realization that <a href="http://lpm.io">lpm.io</a> is the same length as <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a>.</p>

<h2>The shortening method</h2>

<p>I wanted the links to be very short but still look random, so they're not really very random. Links are 3 characters, and must include at least one letter and at least one number. They're case insensitive, so you can read them over the phone or something.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>Private links, track with either email auth or password</li>
<li>Track request referrers</li>
</ul>

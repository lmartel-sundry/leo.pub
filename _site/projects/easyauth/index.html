<h1>EasyAuth</h1>

<p>A little daemon that uses Twilio and Mailgun to intercept SMS messages and forward them to other phone numbers and email addresses. Use it to make Stanford 2Factor authentication less of a hassle!</p>

<h2>Tech Stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ruby with Sinatra</li>
<li>Twilio API (10/10, would API again)</li>
</ul>


<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>Integrate Google Authenticator or similar. This would shave a second or two off the code generation time.</li>
</ul>

=================

This is my personal website! Here you can read my blog (just in case I ever post anything on it), look at some of my programming side projects, check out my credentials if you're a recruiter or weird, or just say hi. I had a lot of fun building this website, so if you have ideas about more things to put on it I'd love to hear them!

Tech stuff:
-----------
- Static site (that's HTML/CSS/JS)
- Built with Jekyll
- Markup and templating: HAML, Liquid, and Markdown
- Development and compilation tools: Compass, Foreman

About the Repository
--------------------
This repo has two branches with different stuff in them: 

The *develop* branch has all the code used by compass, foreman, and jekyll to build the site. This is where I actually write my code and content. 

The *master* branch has only the compiled content; it's the "actual" site, and it gets served by github automatically when it's updated.
